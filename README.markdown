Welcome to Foundation
=====================

Foundation is the most advanced framework in the world for rapidly prototyping and iterating into production code. It includes a 12-column, future-friendly grid and tons of great tools and elements that'll get you up and running in no time. You can use Foundation by downloading the CSS, customizing a CSS download, or using the Sass/Compass gem.
